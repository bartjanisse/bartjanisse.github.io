During this assignment I got excited about \href{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html}{\tt {\bfseries Doxygen}}. Dogygen is a tool which can be used to produce documentation in broad sense. One of the possibilities is to generate documentation from comments in source file. The webpage you are reading right now is created with Doxygen.
