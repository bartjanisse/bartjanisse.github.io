\paragraph*{Assignment description}

The main goal of this application is to explore how specific U\-S\-B hardware can be controlled. For this goal a Datel Xbox 360 controller will be used. Although it is not an original Microsoft one it should be 100\% compatible. Below an image of this controller is given.



The software developed for this assignment is using the libusb library. This library provides an abstraction for communication with U\-S\-B devices.

\paragraph*{Extra's}

During this assignment I got excited about Doxygen. Dogygen is a tool which can be used to produce documentation in broad sense. One of the possibilities is to generate documentation from comments in source file. The webpage you are reading right now is created with Doxygen.

\paragraph*{Building the source}

Please refer to the \doxyref{Building the source files}{p.}{page1} page for more information on this topic.
