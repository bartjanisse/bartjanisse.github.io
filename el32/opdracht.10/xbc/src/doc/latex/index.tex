\paragraph*{Assignment description}

The main goal of this application is to explore how specific U\-S\-B hardware can be controlled. For this goal a Datel Xbox 360 controller will be used. Although it is not an original Microsoft one it should be 100\% compatible. Below an image of this controller is given.



The software developed for this assignment is using the {\tt {\bfseries libusb}} library. This library provides an abstraction for communication with U\-S\-B devices. The assignment has the following requirements\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The program can show the states of all the buttons; 
\item The program can controll the L\-E\-D's; 
\item The program can controll the rumble actuator; 
\item The program can be build with a Makefile; 
\item The program can run on the Raspberry Pi; 
\item The software is documentated. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Building the source}

Please refer to the \doxyref{Building the source files}{p.}{page1} page for more information on this topic. 

\paragraph*{How it all works}

On the \doxyref{How it all works}{p.}{page3} page a detailed description is given on this topic. 

\paragraph*{Extra's}

During this assignment I got excited about {\tt {\bfseries Doxygen}}. Dogygen is a tool which can be used to produce documentation in broad sense. One of the possibilities is to generate documentation from comments in source file. The webpage you are reading right now is created with Doxygen.
